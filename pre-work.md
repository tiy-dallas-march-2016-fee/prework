# Pre-work

So, you want to take our Front-End Engineering class! That's fantastic. Here's some pre-work to get you ready for the grueling yet rewarding adventure in front of you.

## Accounts

Go ahead and sign up for these as we'll be using using them throughout the course if you haven't already.

1. http://github.com
2. http://twitter.com
3. http://medium.com (or some other blogging platform like Wordpress, assuming you don't have a blog for technical stuff already)
4. http://trello.com (sign-in with your Google account for easier access)

## Software

The course requires that you have a Mac. Please install the following software. Both are free. If you have issues with these, let me know.

1. Atom (The editor we will use - https://atom.io/)
2. iTerm 2 (A better terminal client than what's built-in with OSX - https://www.iterm2.com/)
3. Install Git. If you install Xcode from the Mac App Store (free), it will install Git. We won't be using Xcode in this course but if you ever do any iOS development, you will. There are alternative ways to install Git as well: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
4. Install Node. You can download the installer here: https://nodejs.org/en/. Install the stable version.

## Mindset

Your attitude towards learning and personal/professional growth is crucial for your success. Here are some things along those lines to watch and read that you might find helpful.

## Blogging

Having a home on the web for you can be a very valuable tool for you as a budding technical professional because there is a lot of value in owning your name on the web. The Google searches of potential employers should be able to find you. This allows you to both better control what they will see and why you can be valuable as an employee. Above I noted that you should have some blog. If you already have one, good for you. Keep using it. If not, sign up for a blog on Medium (or Wordpress or something else).

Why? [Watch this video on branding](http://blog.theironyard.com/2015/02/25/bb-workshop/).

As an added level of awesomeness, I would also recommend setting up your blog using a custom domain name. It takes a little bit more setup but all the major blogging sites should allow you to do this (Medium, https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/categories/201974997-Custom-Domains; Wordpress, https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/). In other words, if your name is Bart Rogers, you don't want `bartrogers.wordpress.com`. You want `bartrogers.com`. If this is too much trouble for you at this point, just get started. But I'd strongly recommend some plan to move to a custom domain.

## Why Are You Doing This To Yourself?

On the one hand, this course is going to be very difficult and will require a ton of work. Correction, this *career* is difficult and requires a ton of work. At some points along the way, you might ask yourself why you chose to put yourself through so much. On the other hand, if this is really the career that you want, then I can tell you that all the work is going to be worth it. It's a great career. So I can learn more about you, encourage you, and so you have something to look back at to encourage yourself, write a message to me (email: eric.sowell@theironyard.com), and answer these questions:

1. Changing careers will change your life? What is your biggest fear? What are you most excited about?
2. What do you expect to be most difficult about the class?
3. What do you hope to be able to do after the class is over?
4. Knowing that you should have already tried to spend some time learning before the class, what do you expect the class to do for you that would be harder to do alone?

If you are comfortable sharing some of this publicly, this might also make a great post for your (possibly new) blog.
