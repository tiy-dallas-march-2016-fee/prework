# Prework

Hey, this is the repo for pre-work for my Front-End Engineering class starting March 21st! If you are joining or at least interested, check out the following:

1. [pre-work.md](https://github.com/tiy-dallas-march-2016-fee/prework/blob/master/pre-work.md) - Some things to do, some software to install, and some things to read or watch to prepare you for the course (and your career).
1. [pre-prep.md](https://github.com/tiy-dallas-march-2016-fee/prework/blob/master/pre-prep.md) - It's not long before the class begins but getting a head start on some of the tech we'll be using is a good idea if you have time. Here are some links.
1. [code-school-manifesto.md](https://github.com/tiy-dallas-march-2016-fee/prework/blob/master/code-school-manifesto.md) - Want to know what we're all about? Read this.
