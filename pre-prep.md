# Pre-prep

We have a *lot* to cover in our twelve weeks. Getting a head start will help you out. I know that you don't have enough time to do all of this but I would recommend trying out some of this.

### Terminal

The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. We will be using the command line extensively in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

Especially if youâ€™ve never used the command line before, you may want to go through these more than once. Make sure not just to read/watch, but really dive in and use the commands that you learn about.
